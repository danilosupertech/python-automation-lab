# 🧪 python-automation-lab

Practical Python automations focused on real-world tasks (files, CSVs, APIs) with a **small, clean MVP approach**.

## Goals
- Build confidence through small deliverables
- Ship portable scripts (Linux/WSL)
- Keep the repo professional and easy to navigate

## Projects
- **P01 — Bill Organizer (MVP)** → organizes PDF bills into folders and generates a simple summary
- P02 — CSV Cleaner (planned)
- P03 — API Report (planned)

## Quick start
```bash
cd projects/p01-bill-organizer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m bill_organizer --help
```
